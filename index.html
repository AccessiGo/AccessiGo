      Accessigo is a web app that displays a map of the University of Windsor campus highlighting accessible building entrances. The goal is to make it easier for students, staff, and visitors with mobility challenges to find barrier-free entry points around campus.

      Right now, Accessigo focuses on outdoor accessibility, showing which building entrances are wheelchair-accessible and clearly marking them on an interactive map. Future versions will expand to include other accessibility features such as indoor navigation, elevators, and ramps.</h2>
